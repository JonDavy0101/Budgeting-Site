# Budgeting-Site
> This is an sample of a budgeting website that I built. The backend is run with PHP. I used MySQL for the database. HTML and CSS comprise the design with jQuery and JavaScript helping with its functionality. I ran this website from a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) that I set up on a server.
>
> This was one of my first big projects. I designed and built everything from the ground up from the graphic design to the back-end to the front-end. This project gave me much experience with servers. Using a virtual machine running Ubuntu, I set up a LAMP stack. Then I designed my website with PHP, HTML, CSS, jQuery, and JavaScript. I developed the website to be dynamic, allowing it to work well as a budgeting site.

> Building this site was one of the funnest projects I have ever worked on. I am still adding features to it; come back later to see my progress.
